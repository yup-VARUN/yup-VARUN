I'm down to collaborate on impactful projects that truly can add some value to our civilization.

Hi, nice to see you here! I'm **Varun Ahlawat**. Currently doing bachelors' in two majors: Computer Science & Physics @GeorgiaStateUniversity.

- I just built a state-of-the-art RAG(retrieval augmented generation) pipeline application called DiagnAI. I am still working on perfecting it out and designing a custom evaluation pipeline for it! I'll be proud of it once finished deployment!
- I'm the president of , Rocket Technologies GSU, started working on:
``` bash
https://github.com/rocket-tech-gsu/HPR_LVL1.git
```
  - $E \neq m_{o}c^2$
    - Where $$m_{o}$$ is the rest mass of matter.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer Science and Physics. `(Physics > GF)` but `(GF > CS)`!
- `I make rockets`, because it's challenging ðŸš€
- Iâ€™ve done some industrial work on Data Science & analytics. I'm well versed with full stack web development, machine learning, AI or as the cool kids call it "Deep Learning" (NLP, RNN, LSTMs, attention and positional encoding(transformers)). I also have extensive experience with embedded systems programming and more...
- $E = \sqrt{(m_{o}c^2)^2+(pc^2)^2}$
- ðŸ“« To reach me use my email address ahlawatvarun312@gmail.com, well I'm bad at replying to emails, but I use hella discord.
  - But if you really want to reach me FTL then use my work email â€“Â vahlawat1@student.gsu.edu

Academic Papers Read:
- Attention is all you need.
- Scaling laws by openAI.
- Training llms(llama) by Meta.
- Siamese architecture, Diffusion Models, and some Retrieval stuff...
