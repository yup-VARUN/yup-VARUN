# Varun Ahlawat

Full Stack Systems engineer focused on multi-agent AI, Deep RL, RAG pipelines, and distributed compute. Actively coding production-grade systems since May 2025.

## Projects

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration (May–Nov 2025):** Built a fully functional, production-ready, serverless microservices AI agent platform from scratch. Integrated Document Intelligence, QuickBooks, ERPNext, Gmail, Calendar; cloud-based chat interface with Cursor IDE-like intelligent grepping (`@` partial, `#` full). Tech Stack: TS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, React; no off-the-shelf agent library used.
- [**Winner** + Team Lead] **AI ATL 2025 Hackathon – HeyAI:** Web + API for chatbot URL → voice in a weekend; Go-based multi-threaded voice server; integrated custom inference backend.  [Devpost Submission](https://devpost.com/software/heyai-dgbk7j)
- **RAG & ML Pipelines:** Retrieval-augmented generation systems; custom evaluation; novel spectral data augmentation for CNNs on scarce datasets. Deployed as GCP's Cloud Run.
- **RL & Hardware – Rocket Technologies GSU(President for 1.5 yrs):** Actor-critic RL MPC packages from scratch including hardware; taught  embedded systems, deep RL in community.  
  - [GNC_to_the_moon](https://github.com/rocket-tech-gsu/GNC_to_the_moon)  
- **Research & AGI Benchmarking:** Actively experimenting with frontier architectures, deep RL training of custom instances, and holistic benchmarking of AGI-relevant systems. Open-source community: [Discord](https://discord.gg/PPBVNpr3rX).
