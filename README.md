# Varun Ahlawat

Systems engineer focused on AI agents, reinforcement learning, and distributed infrastructure.

## Projects & Highlights

- **May–Nov 2025:** Independently designed and implemented a production-grade multi-agent orchestration system, including tool-usage primitives and ERP integrations. Deployed a live demo and actively maintained the codebase throughout.
- **RAG & ML pipelines:** Built retrieval-augmented generation systems for personalized applications, including a custom evaluation framework. Developed novel data augmentation techniques for spectral multi-class classification, enabling larger CNNs on scarce datasets.
- **Reinforcement learning & hardware:** President of Rocket Technologies GSU; developed actor-critic RL-based model-predictive control packages from scratch, including hardware interfacing. Founded and teach in an RL community, covering deep RL from first principles to modern gradient flows.
- **Research engagement:** Regularly read and implement concepts from state-of-the-art AI research, including transformers, continual pre-training, memory architectures, and diffusion models.

Actively coding daily on modern AI systems, multi-agent orchestration, and distributed compute infrastructure. Open to technical discussions and code reviews.
