- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Varun Ahlawat**. I'm studying Computer Science & Physics at `not an ivy league`.
  - $E \neq mc^2$
  - $E = \sqrt{(mc^2)^2+(pc^2)^2}$
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer Science and Physics. `(Physics > GF)` but `(CS < GF)`!
- ðŸš€ I hate when someone uses this EMOJI FOR NO DAMN REASON! btw `I make rockets`, because it's challenging AF!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve learned Data Science & analytics, full stack web development, machine learning, artificial intelligence(NLP, ANN, RNN, LSTMs, attention and positional encoding(in simpler wordsâ€“transformers)), and embedded programming.
- I'm down to collaborate on impactful projects that truly can add some value to our civilization.
- This is what me and my organization, Rocket Technologies GSU, started working on:
``` bash
https://github.com/rocket-tech-gsu/HPR_LVL1.git
```
- ðŸ“« To reach me use my email address ahlawatvarun312@gmail.com, well I'm bad at replying to emails, but I use hella discord.
  - But if you really want to reach me FTL then use my work email â€“Â vahlawat1@student.gsu.edu

### Let's study some physics now that you're on my profile!
