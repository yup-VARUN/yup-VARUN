Nice to see you here! 
I'm **Varun Ahlawat**. I've built a good skillset in systems engineering. Lately, I've been reading research papers in the field of AI. I fully understand distributed compute infrastructure on which the entire modern cloud compute stands. I'm down to collaborate on impactful projects that truly can add some value to our civilization. 
Currently I'm doing bachelors' in two majors: Computer Science & Physics.

- As an official Research Intern, I am trying novel things in training neural networks from scratch on a tiny numerical dataset for simple classification for an industrial research project to enable bio markers testing just from Blood's FTIR spectroscopy for disease detection.
- I just built a state-of-the-art RAG(retrieval augmented generation) pipeline application called DiagnAI. I am still working on perfecting it out and designing a custom evaluation pipeline for it! I'll be proud of it once finished deployment! It is so promising that I had to make the repo private :/
- I'm the president of , Rocket Technologies GSU. Building state-of-the-art Actor Critic Reinforcement Learning based Model Predictive Control System package from scratch including hardware :

### Books Read Recently:
- Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann
- The Art of Scalaibility by Martin L. Abbott and Michael T. Fisher
- Infrastructure as Code by Kief Morris
- Kubernetes Up and Running by Kelsey Hightower, Brendan Burns, and Joe Beda
  - $E \neq m_{o}c^2$
    - Where $$m_{o}$$ is the rest mass of matter.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer Science and Physics. `(Physics > GF)` but `(GF > CS)`!
- `I make rockets`, because it's challenging ðŸš€
- Iâ€™ve done some industrial work on Data Science & analytics. I'm well versed with full stack web development, machine learning, AI or as the cool kids call it "Deep Learning" (NLP, RNN, LSTMs, attention and positional encoding(transformers)). I also have extensive experience with embedded systems programming and more...
- $E = \sqrt{(m_{o}c^2)^2+(pc^2)^2}$ -->
