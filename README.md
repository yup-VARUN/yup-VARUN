**I'm literally building AGI along with a group of researchers!** Our platform of choice is discord, here's link to our [server](https://discord.gg/PPBVNpr3rX).

I'm **Varun Ahlawat**. 

Good at systems engineering. Gained highly techical leadership experience. Lately, I've been reading research papers in the field of AI. I do technical work, daily, on modern AI systems and distributed compute infrastructure on which the entire modern cloud compute stands. I'm finishing my bachelors' at `Georgia State University`(only a literal fool would judge me by that fact). I'm a double major, majoring in: Computer Science, Physics.

- As official Research Intern, I have developed novel extreme data augmentation technique for spectral multi class classification based upon spectral data. Motivation: Training larger CNNs on a very hard to record tiny numerical dataset for simple classification for an industrial research project to enable bio markers testing just from Blood's FTIR spectroscopy for disease detection.
- I've built a state-of-the-art RAG(retrieval augmented generation) pipeline for personalized free medical application called DiagnAI(I've pivoted from it). Designed a custom evaluation pipeline for it! I'll be proud of it once finished deployment! It was very promising that I had to make the repo private :/
- I'm the president of **Rocket Technologies GSU**. Building state-of-the-art Actor Critic Reinforcement Learning based Model Predictive Control System package from scratch including hardware :
```

```
- I've built an RL community called `R.L. Folks`:
  - In the initial days of this community I taught modern deep reinforcement learning from the first principles all the way to how the gradients flows.
  - Now we've literally started an AGI research proejct!

### Books Read Recently:
- Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann
- The Art of Scalaibility by Martin L. Abbott and Michael T. Fisher
- Infrastructure as Code by Kief Morris
- Kubernetes Up and Running by Kelsey Hightower, Brendan Burns, and Joe Beda
  - $E \neq m_{o}c^2$
    - Where $$m_{o}$$ is the rest mass of matter.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer Science and Physics. `(Physics > GF)` but `(GF > CS)`!
- `I make rockets`, because it's challenging ðŸš€
- Iâ€™ve done some industrial work on Data Science & analytics. I'm well versed with full stack web development, machine learning, AI or as the cool kids call it "Deep Learning" (NLP, RNN, LSTMs, attention and positional encoding(transformers)). I also have extensive experience with embedded systems programming and more...
- $E = \sqrt{(m_{o}c^2)^2+(pc^2)^2}$ -->
